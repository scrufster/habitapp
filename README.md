# habitapp
Desktop version of HabitApp, the tree canopy coverage assessment tool.

HabitApp uses a photograph of a tree canopy to calculate the percentage coverage provided by the canopy. It is aimed at research scientists for fieldwork.

Once a photo is loaded, the slider is moved until the resulting black and white image best represents the original image. The coverage is then calculated from the percentage of black pixels.

This is the Windows desktop version. Other versions include an Android app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scrufster.habitapp&hl=en&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1), and an online version which is available at http://www.scrufster.com/habitapp.
